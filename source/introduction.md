#Introduction to the project
##What is Rotoforge?
Rotoforge is a free and open source hardware/software 3d printer for printing metal, plastic and ceramic heterogenously on the home desktop safely and affordably with performance similar to FDM. It takes advantage of a technique known as "additive friction stir deposition" or AFSD.

##Why do this? 
1. Because manufacturing freedom for the individual *is* individual creative freedom

2. Plastic trinkets only get you so far

3. A truly self replicating machine and its proported benefits must be able to produce itself *entirely* from raw materials and energy, wherever it might happen to be. Probably, in places that do not include convenient metal foundry and electronics fabrication infrastructure. 

4. Insert your reason here. ;)
