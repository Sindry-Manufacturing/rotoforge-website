## Glow Plug Semisolid Metal Direct Writing

Previously we attempted to construct a improved [semisolid metal direct write printhead](https://hackaday.io/project/179846-semisolid-metal-printing) using a ceramic glow plug, EDM sinker drilled through its tip and central conductive core to make a 1300 C capable heated nozzle with excellent antiwetting protperties for molten metals. 
Some [links to that effort and its files on printables](https://www.printables.com/model/635347-beru-glow-plug-cgp-002)

We made a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DkNUEkR0hs) documenting our process for making the printheads. 

This approach had a few problems we wrote about in our [last blog post](https://dailyrotoforge.blogspot.com/2025/04/metal-fdm-long-journey-with-still.html).
