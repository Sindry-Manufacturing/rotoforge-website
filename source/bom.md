None of the following links are affiliated. You should also feel free to try your own 3D printer, router and other motion control frames! the forces involved are relatively similar to those in FDM.

## A CNC Control Frame
more rigid frames are better for control, but even the 3018 will work... it is probably less rigid than the ender 3 3D printer all things considered.

##Rigid spindle upgrade
This provides a clamp for the motor that wont melt. 3D printed clamps could do as well if they could tolerate te ~50-80 C of the spindle motor body.

##A hard nozzle or tool
Tungsten alloy, tool steel, tungsten carbide are all more affordable alternatives. 1 mm hole is preferred because it is just easier to work with, but smaller nozzle sizes are in the works.

##A spindle motor upgrade
You will need some way to spin the hard tool while in contact with a surface. A hollow shaft DC motor, drilled and tapped to M6 should do the trick. There are likely many other ways to do this as well. Such as off center belted spindles.

##some way to feed material through the nozzle
You will need a way to feed material through the spinning shaft and nozzle to the deposition zone. Its helpful to avoid contact between the material and the shaft walls as the walls tend to act like a centrifuge. Air and water fluidize beds can be used to varying degrees of success. Air being a much more dangerous option. there are likely many other ways to do this, such as auger feed, and gravity feed.
