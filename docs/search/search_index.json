Rotoforge is a free and open source hardware /software 3d printer for printing metal, plastic and ceramic heterogenously on the home desktop safely and affordably with performance similar to FDM. It takes advantage of a technique known as \"additive friction stir deposition\" or AFSD . Why do this? Because manufacturing freedom for the individual is individual creative freedom Plastic trinkets only get you so far A truly self replicating machine and its proported benefits must be able to produce itself entirely from raw materials and energy, wherever it might happen to be. Probably, in places that do not include convenient metal foundry and electronics fabrication infrastructure. Insert your reason here. ;)","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction-to-the-project","text":"","title":"Introduction to the project"},{"location":"#what-is-rotoforge","text":"Rotoforge is a free and open source hardware /software 3d printer for printing metal, plastic and ceramic heterogenously on the home desktop safely and affordably with performance similar to FDM.

You should also feel free to try your own 3D printer, router and other motion control frames! The forces involved are relatively similar to those in FDM. A CNC Control Frame more rigid frames are better for control, but even the 3018 will work... it is probably less rigid than the ender 3 3D printer all things considered. Genmitsu3018PRO The Genmitsu 3020 pro is a much nicer frame still... Rigid spindle upgrade This provides a clamp for the motor that wont melt. 3D printed clamps could do as well if they could tolerate te ~50-80 C of the spindle motor body. Genmitsu3018spindleupgrade A hard nozzle or tool Tungsten alloy, tool steel, tungsten carbide are all more affordable alternatives. 1 mm hole is preferred because it is just easier to work with, but smaller nozzle sizes are in the works. Diamondback polycrystalline diamond nozzle A spindle motor upgrade You will need some way to spin the hard tool while in contact with a surface. A hollow shaft DC motor, drilled and tapped to M6 should do the trick. There are likely many other ways to do this as well. Such as off center belted spindles. hollow shaft DC motor some way to feed material through the nozzle You will need a way to feed material through the spinning shaft and nozzle to the deposition zone. Its helpful to avoid contact between the material and the shaft walls as the walls tend to act like a centrifuge. Air and water fluidize beds can be used to varying degrees of success. Air being a much more dangerous option. there are likely many other ways to do this, such as auger feed, and gravity feed. 100 mm 20 gauge material deposition needles","title":"BOM"},{"location":"bom/#rotoforge-bill-of-materials","text":"None of the following links are affiliated.

Find a set of off the shelf (OTS) parts that, when brought together can form a widely accessible development platform for AFSD on the home desktop. (achieved) Reliably deposit various metals on various substrates. (achieved) Create solid layers of metallic materials on substrates. The end result that meets this objective is a single layer PCB that is useable. (work in progress) Build 3D layers of metallic materials on substrates, and on themselves. For example, a simple hollow cube of aluminum. (work in progress) Repeat objective 2-4 for ceramics and plastics, especially those not currently printable with other methods. Develop a fully closed loop control system for monitoring the printing process. Success at this would be, collecting reliable temperature, pressure, chemical and force sensing data at the deposition zone. Eventually, being able to automatically devise printing parameters on demand for a given material. Build a community of operators capable of printing the basic components of a rotoforge from raw materials at tremendously low cost to start bringing the system to a wider and wider group of users.
